The project focuses on unsupervised feature learning from time-series data using a Siamese network trained 
with a differentiable version of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as a loss function. The objective is to align 
feature representations for similar activities while maintaining separability for dissimilar ones.

To run the code, you need to make sure the following packages are installed:
- torch
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- random
- sklearn
- seaborn
- time
- urllib
- os
- zipfile
- sys
- pysdtw

You can then run the whole project with the Unsupervized_Feature_Alignment_with_Soft_DTW.ipynb notebook. It will create the necessary folders and download the dataset for you. The notebook is divided into sections that will guide you through the different steps of the project.
